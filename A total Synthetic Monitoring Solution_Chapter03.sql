When a stress testing request is made to the gateway layer (cyborg-flow-gateway), tags will be made to stress testing data according to configuration in the configuration file. The tags will be passed to distributed link system and flow information could be seen (cyborg-dashboard) throughout the whole link. Before requesting the database, the link tracing service will add stress testing tags to execution SQL through HINT.
